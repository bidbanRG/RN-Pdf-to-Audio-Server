the best means and the best goals can never be discerned with certainty. An aim, anambition, provides the structure necessary for action. An aim provides a destination, apoint of contrast against the present, and a framework, within which all things can beevaluated. An aim defines progress and makes such progress exciting. An aim reducesanxiety, because if you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing, and neitherof those two options makes for a tranquil spirit. Thus, we have to think, and plan, andlimit, and posit, in order to live at all. How then to envision the future, and establish ourdirection, without falling prey to the temptation of totalitarian certainty?Some reliance on tradition can help us establish our aims. It is reasonable to do whatother people have always done, unless we have a very good reason not to. It is reasonableto become educated and work and find love and have a family. That is how culturemaintains itself. But it is necessary to aim at your target, however traditional, with youreyes wide open. You have a direction, but it might be wrong. You have a plan, but itmight be ill-formed. You may have been led astray by your own ignorance—and, worse,by your own unrevealed corruption. You must make friends, therefore, with what youdon’t know, instead of what you know. You must remain awake to catch yourself in theact. You must remove the beam in your own eye, before you concern yourself with themote in your brother’s. And in this way, you strengthen your own spirit, so it can toleratethe burden of existence, and you rejuvenate the state.The ancient Egyptians had already figured this out thousands of years ago, althoughtheir  knowledge  remained  embodied  in  dramatic  form.154  They  worshipped  Osiris,mythological  founder  of  the  state  and  the  god  of  tradition.  Osiris,  however,  wasvulnerable to overthrow and banishment to the underworld by Set, his evil, schemingbrother. The Egyptians represented in story the fact that social organizations ossify withtime,  and  tend  towards  willful  blindness.  Osiris  would  not  see  his  brother’s  truecharacter, even though he could have. Set waits and, at an opportune moment, attacks.He hacks Osiris into pieces, and scatters the divine remains through the kingdom. Hesends his brother’s spirit to the underworld. He makes it very difficult for Osiris to pullhimself back together.Fortunately, the great king did not have to deal with Set on his own. The Egyptians alsoworshipped Horus, the son of Osiris. Horus took the twin forms of a falcon, the mostvisually acute of all creatures, and the still-famous hieroglyphic single Egyptian eye (asalluded to in Rule 7). Osiris is tradition, aged and willfully blind. Horus, his son, couldand would, by contrast, see. Horus was the god of attention. That is not the same asrationality. Because he paid attention, Horus could perceive and triumph against the evilsof Set, his uncle, albeit at great cost. When Horus confronts Set, they have a terriblebattle. Before Set’s defeat and banishment from the kingdom, he tears out one of hisnephew’s eyes. But the eventually victorious Horus takes back the eye. Then he doessomething truly unexpected: he journeys voluntarily to the underworld and gives the eye to hisfather.What  does  this  mean?  First,  that  the  encounter  with  malevolence  and  evil  is  ofsufficient terror to damage even the vision of a god; second, that the attentive son can restorethe  vision  of  his  father.  Culture  is  always  in  a  near-dead  state,  even  though  it  wasestablished by the spirit of great people in the past. But the present is not the past. Thewisdom of the past thus deteriorates, or becomes outdated, in proportion to the genuinedifference between the conditions of the present and the past. That is a mere consequenceof the passage of time, and the change that passage inevitably brings. But it is also thecase that culture and its wisdom is additionally vulnerable to corruption—to voluntary,willful blindness and Mephistophelean intrigue. Thus, the inevitable functional decline ofthe institutions granted to us by our ancestors is sped along by our misbehavior—ourmissing of the mark—in the present.156
